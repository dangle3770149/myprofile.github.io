                <h1 class="subprojectheading">Project Ideas</h1>
                <h2 class="subprojectheading2">Overview</h2>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Auto-Chat is an online service that allows customers to create custom chatbots for websites and Facebook messenger. The customers could use Auto-Chat for individual/business purposes, including FAQ, reservation, support service and optimized marketing activities. Auto-Chat has different subscription plans + demos for the customers based on their purpose. Auto-Chat has a forum where members could share information, support others and evaluate the system. The interface of the Auto-Chat website has a friendly design that provides a comfortable environment for customers while exploring features. At Auto-Chat, a member has options to create their chatbot or choose a  design template shared on the forum. The chatbot of Auto-Chat is powered by AI, which is more intelligent, self-optimized, and close to the level of human communications (Debecker, 2017).</p>
                <h2 class="subprojectheading2">Motivation</h2>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Since the Covid-19 pandemic, social distance and government restrictions have changed consumer shopping behaviour and interaction in the digital world. The Australian market expected 85.2% of people to be shopping online in 2021, a growth of 5% from 2019 (WebAlive, 2019). Another large eCommerce market, the US, reports 46% of consumers are shopping online frequently since the start of Covid-19 in March 2020 (Channeladvisor, 2020). Online businesses recognize their customer support department under pressure when more people need support while they are shopping. According to the PRNewswire research, 80% of consumers expected the customer's business service to be more responsive, and 30% of customers wouldn't come back if the company had a lousy support service. Further, a McKinsey article showed 75% of people request support within 5-min. Also, the business could increase 5 to 10% of revenue if they offer a satisfying customer experience.<br><br>To help businesses optimize the customer experience and save spending on hiring more staff for the support department. Auto-Chat is developing to assist the business to solve the problem. </p>
                <h2 class="subprojectheading2">Description</h2>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Auto-Chat provides several features to help businesses achieve their purposes.</p>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #1: Manageable users Interface and type of message appearance</h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">The tutorial is well organized, and so the new user doesn't waste their time dealing with masses of information when they experience creating their chatbot. The back-end command coding will appear as an icon, which people can click and input into the chat flow. A description file of icons is ready for the users to download, or they can see the description when they click on the icon. Auto-chat offers different message options for the business; they can choose to appear a message with text only, text & image, or a card (combination between image and click button).</p>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #2: Merge with Facebook Messenger </h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">According to a Statista report, Facebook is the largest social media platform with over 2 billion users worldwide, and many businesses use Facebook for their advertisement activities. Auto-Chat will allow the business to link their chatbot on Facebook Messenger. After merging with Messenger, any change on the Auto-Chat will also update on Facebook Messenger.</p>
                <p1 class="subprojectparg1">1.Create a chatbot on Auto-Chat<br>2.Connect Facebook account with Auto-Chat<br>3.At Facebook, go to Setting -> Business Integrations -> Find Auto-Chat<br>4.Active Auto-chat </p1>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #3: Network for Auto-Chat Users</h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Auto-Chat offers a forum for the users to connect and share their resources with other members. The content of the forum will be organized under relevant categories of different fields of business. The categories are Discussion (Chat between User - User), Q&A (Chat between User - Customer Service) and Public Template. In addition, public Template features categories in the forum, where users can upload their custom chatbot to the public and others can input and edit at their desktop.</p>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #4: Auto-Chat is AI Chatbot and Data Scanning</h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">The Chatbot is powered by Artificial Intelligence and will help end-users experience quick response and natural communication like talking to the real human (Arora, 2020). The AI Chatbot also collects data from chat history and filters the FAQ and keyword (under the hashtag). For example, #cake, #lookingfortable, #saving. The data will help the business understand the demand of their customers. Businesses could use FAQ to optimize their Chatbot and Keyword for running ads and improve SEO ranking.</p>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #5: Back-Up Plan</h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Back-Up Plan is available at Auto-Chat service. Auto-Chat allows the business to use a second administrator account depending on the consumer's purposes such as management, advertisement and protection. The users can sync selecting data to their connected account. Back-Up Plan is available for three reasons:</p>
                <p1 class="subprojectparg1">1.Users want to transfer or delete their current version when they believe it is under cyber attack.<br>2.Users want to separate content.<br>3.Back-up Account</p1>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #6: Strict Policy, High Security</h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">As a private cloud server, Auto-Chat provides a high-security storage infrastructure for the users to store business information and their customer's information with a protected policy. Auto-Chat development policy follows the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) and the Privacy Act. The policy will protect users and end-users from leaking private information such as addresses, phone numbers, and emails. Also, prevent the users from using chatbots for scamming, spamming and other illegal purposes.</p>
                <h3 class="subprojectheading3">Feature #7: Monthly Subscriber Plan</h3>
                <p class="subprojectparg">There are three levels of the Subscriber Plan. At level 1, the users will have limited tools and storage size. At level 2, the users would use all the features available at Auto-Chat, such as a forum, Back-Up Plan and unlimited contact storage. Finally, at level 3, it is the same as level 2, but the subscriber has priority at consumer support.</p>
                <h2 class="subprojectheading2">Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p class="subprojectparg">At the preparation stages, the project idea aims to raise funds from the technology investors. Then, the money will be spent to build infrastructure and AI development.
                    <br><br>For storage and operating process, Auto-chat selected hardware from Dell. The expected hardware is PowerEdge R840 Rack Server (4-socket). The hardware provided high performance and scalability in processing applications at database workload. Furthermore, as a trend of cloud servers in 2021 (Rishabh, 2019), Auto-Chat will select Private Cloud as the business server. Private Cloud provides a high level of security; also, the business is easy to update, manage and maintain systems.
                    <br><br>The feature components developing Custom AI ChatBot & User Interface are CPU, GPU, and RAM. CPU is the brain that processes data, the GPU will process graphic units such as Image or Video, and RAM is used for storing data while developing. Auto-Chat is expected to purchase AMD Threadripper for AI development when AMD is the leading brand of AI Computer CPUs (Montantes, 2021). Other components, GPU is from Nvidia technology, and RAM is from Micron or Samsung with 3200MHz. The software used for coding AI is Pycharm and Visual Coding Studio for User Interface.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subprojectheading2">Skill Required</h2>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Some skills front-end developers need are HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and understanding software frameworks such as Bootstrap, AngularJS, ReactJS, Ember. At the back-end, the developer will be coding AI using Python, so the developer needs to understand Python Language strongly, also Pycharm, software used for coding AI in the project plan. 
                    <br><br>Existing technologies inspire the project idea. Some companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Domino currently use their AI Chatbot. Besides IT courses during university, we could improve our coding skills when working as freelancers on Fiverr or at an agency. Depending on the budget, we could build our server by purchasing hardware from providers such as Dell, HPE, and Huawei or using a public service provided by Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle. Some coding editors that could develop the user interface and AI are Visual Coding Studio, Pycharm, Kite, and Pylint.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subprojectheading2">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="subprojectparg">Auto-Chat aims to help the user optimize the customer experience, release the pressure and save budget from hiring staff for customer service. By using AI ChatBot, the business could understand consumer purchase behaviour by collecting and evaluating data from the chat history. On the end-user side, people experience quick response, smartness and feeling of human-human communications while they use the service. AI ChatBot is a future solution for online customer support service. 
                    <br><br>On the other hand, in the future, they will replace the rule-based chatbot when AI ChatBot has a more intelligent and friendly response with the users. Furthermore, they could threaten the human customer service staff when they have a higher score of customer satisfaction with which they have both quality and quantity of reply (Walch, 2019).
