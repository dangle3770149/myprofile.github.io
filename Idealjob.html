                <h1 class="subidealheading">Ideal Job</h1>
                <p class="subidealparg">The developer will work on front-end and back-end website development by using the WordPress platform. Also, The developer will collaborate with the design team to deliver satisfied website design concepts to the client. I found a passion working as a WordPress developer at Hindsight Design when they have many clients. Therefore, I expect to experience several designs in different business sectors, such as eCommerce or Magazine websites.</p>
                <p class="subidealparg">A candidate required experience of 2+ years working with web development, especially in WordPress websites. A candidate required experience working with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.  A developer needs experience in practising with site builders like Elementor, Divi, Visual Composer. It required the developer to understand well using plugins (WooCommerce) and hosting fundamentals (CPANEL). A candidate required good communication skills with the client, a sense of design and helping optimize website ranking by using SEO, Google Search Console and Google Analytics.</p>
                <p class="subidealparg">Currently, I have little experience working with HTML/CSS + Javascript due to my past internships at local businesses. However, during the internship experiences, I can work with both clients and agencies to solve problems via creating strategies for ads on websites. Some website problems are related to security; for example, SSL certificates didn't appear on the website, and the solution is that I have asked the website coders to switch HTTPS in code as default. My team and I also helped businesses connect website links to their social media platforms and applied SEO to the website to help it optimize ranking in search engines.</p>
                <p class="subidealparg" \>According to the requirements of my ideal jobs, I have noted two keywords: web design practice and on-page SEO. The following approach based on two keywords will help me satisfy the job's requirements. Besides the main course at the university, I plan to look for more online classes where I could learn about UI/ UX design. UI/ UX design is necessary for both today's website and app (Singh, 2019). As the article mentions, the better UI/UX design, the better consumer interaction with the website will satisfy the client guideline. Besides the WordPress website, I plan to familiarize myself with others hosting such as Hostinger and Wix. In case I choose another company. Some online courses I have found are SkillShare and youtube tutorials. In year two, I plan to work as a freelancer on Fiverr, which builds websites for individual purposes such as personal portfolio websites and small online businesses. I expected Fiverr to be a suitable environment for me to practice working on different types of website design. I will try to apply to the company that offers an internship position in year three and expect to develop more skills such as teamwork, communication and strong practising website development.</p>
